================

A manifesto about attitude towards life

##Manifesto

Through my experiences, good and bad, observations and introspection, I come to renounce:

1. **Procrastination** and commit to *immediate action*

2. **Judgement** and commit to *understanding and tender care*

3. Expecting **perfection** from myself and others and commit to *being conscious of limitations* and weaknesses, mine and of others, and continuously *improve being supportive and understanding*

4. **Laziness** and all its forms and manifestations and commit to *not taking shortcuts, not substituting hardwork, dedication and sacrifice* but rest when necessary and deserved

5. **Pessimism, negativism and disbelief** in all great things life has reserved for me and commit to *counting my blessings, appreciating each moment, never skipping an opportunity to be and make someone happy*.


And, above everything else, **I renounce to just being alive and commit to life and living.**
